What is HTP?
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
WWW is about communication between web clients and servers
Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses

Consume HTTP Services 
- We use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.co
m/posts
- It is fake service/API for demo Purpose
- we can create,delete,upadte and get the data (i.e. Curd Opeartion) but it can't store in database when you refresh the page.
- install http service
npm install @angular/http@latest
- http.get()
It Returns (return type ) Observable<Response>
what is obervable?
It is asynchronous non blocking operations, now here we go to network we call the server but it not available immediately. Its going to some delay, may be 10msec, or half sec its depends on availability  of server so during this time as excuting the code to get block of data so we use obervable when the result is ready to notify for that. obsrvable we have to call method subscribe(). When result is ready will be notify.

Http Request Method
Method	 Description
Get	Get Data
Post	Create Data
Put	Update Data
Delete	Delete Data

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.
An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from https://domain-a.com uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.
